# RDF/OWL or LPG:

### A Beginner’s Guide to Making the Right Choice

## Description

Knowledge graphs have long underpinned enterprise data strategies, implemented through disparate paradigms ranging from RDF-based semantic technologies to labelled property graphs (LPGs). While these frameworks have often operated quietly in the background, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has reignited interest in knowledge graphs, bringing long-overdue recognition to their strategic value. Knowledge graphs not only enhance LLM training and deployment but also offer unmatched capabilities for optimizing data integration, governance, and analytics.
Yet, fundamental questions remain: What exactly constitutes a knowledge graph? When should RDF, OWL, or LPGs be applied? Are these technologies interchangeable, complementary, or competitive?
This tutorial will demystify these approaches through a pragmatic, hands-on lens. Presenters—bringing distinct perspectives from both RDF and LPG traditions—will guide participants through real-world scenarios, comparative exercises, and applied case studies. Attendees will gain a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs, synergies, and integration pathways across semantic technologies, property graphs, and their integration with LLMs, equipping them to make informed architectural choices in both enterprise and research settings.

#### Participants will explore

- The core principles and unique capabilities of semantic technologies and property graphs.
- Practical decision-making frameworks for selecting the right approach for specific use cases.
- Insights into emerging trends where these approaches converge to unlock new opportunities.
- Considerations to take into account when choosing the tools in order to ensure a smooth implementation.
- Learn about some high-level strategies for utilizing graph technologies to augment LLMs and drive business value.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the strengths, limitations, and synergies of these approaches, enabling them to make informed decisions that align with their organizational goals when solving different challenges.

## Key Topics

- Knowledge graphs
- Semantic technologies: RDF and OWL for building knowledge graphs
- Labelled property graphs for knowledge graphs

## Target Audience:

Knowledge Engineers, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Managers overseeing the above roles

## Workshop Goals

Through the creation of a KG – using both Semantic technologies and a labelled property graph – participants will gain a deeper understanding of the strengths, limitations, capabilities, and synergies of these approaches and will be better placed to make informed decisions as to which approach / tools to select given their particular problem set and goals.

## Format

This workshop will be interactive and hands-on. Participants will be introduced to the basics of knowledge graphs, semantic technologies, and labelled property graphs, which will be followed by the application of these technologies to solve specific problem statements. Using Protégé (an open source tool) and a free version of Neo4j, participants will create knowledge graphs to solve multiple problems and evaluate the effectiveness of their chosen approach.

## Level

Beginner/intermediate

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Familiarity with knowledge graphs and a basic understanding of semantic technologies and/or labelled property graphs is helpful, but not required.
